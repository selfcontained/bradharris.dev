# ‚úåÔ∏è Its me

Hello, I'm Brad Harris. I help build products with software, and love the web ‚ù§Ô∏è. I live in Castle Rock, Colorado and stay busy enjoying life with my family.

I'm currently working at <a href="https://slack.com/">Slack</a>, focusing on the developer platform. I've worked on the <a href="https://slack.com/features/workflow-automation">Workflow Builder</a> tool, and am currently working our our <a href="https://api.slack.com/future">future</a> version of the platform for developers, which is full of fun challenges, like our <a href="https://deno.com/blog/slack">Deno runtime</a> for Slack Functions.

I joined Slack when they <a href="https://slack.com/blog/productivity/slack-acquires-robot-pencils-missions-to-make-it-easy-for-non-tech-teams-to-streamline-work">acquired</a> the workflow product we were building at <a href="https://www.robotsandpencils.com">Robots & Pencils</a> called <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/missions">Missions</a>. Before that, we were building a bot-hosting platform called <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/beep-boop">BeepBoop</a>, which ultimately pivoted into the Missions product. Both of those were incredibly fun products to help shape and build with an amazing team to work alongside.

Prior to that, I worked at <a href="https://yahoo.com">Yahoo!</a> on a myriad of publishing-related products. I had a short hiautus during my stint at Yahoo!, and met some of <a href="https://twitter.com/cnallen">my</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/mbrevoort">favorite</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/chris_skud">people</a> working at Pearson that I'd end up spending years working with later.

My professional career started several years before that as I focused on front-end development working on a large enterprise J2EE web-based product, and then at the New Mexico Game and Fish. To this day, their <a href="https://onlinesales.wildlife.state.nm.us/">online licensing system</a> is still using the same YUI-based front-end components üòÖ and PHP backend for the lottery system I helped build (one of the few things I've written that still exists!). At the time, I was the young one, just out of college, and Javascript wasn't something anyone else wanted to deal with. That was the spark that lit the fire üî• for me, and I've always stayed close to front-end web development since.
