After a lot of work on my part, and on the owners, a project I've been working on for awhile went live.  [Pujbaby.com][puj] went live this weekend.  Congratulations to them, and I'm glad to have this project go live.  We have more work to do, but they now have their online store in production.

Part of getting [pujbaby.com][puj] live was acquiring a new server from [MediaTemple][].  We went with their Dedicated Virtual Server, and so far I've really been impressed with it.  I haven't moved all my sites over to it yet, but its been performing much better than the Grid Server account we've been using (which performs quite well considered the cost and features provided).  If you're looking to upgrade your hosting environment, but keep the costs relatively low, then definitely check it out (no i'm not getting any referral bonuses :) ).
