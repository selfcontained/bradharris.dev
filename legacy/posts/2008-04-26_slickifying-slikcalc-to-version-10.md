A new version of [slikcalc][] was released.  This release simplified some code, mainly the [slikcalc.formatCurrency() method][slikcalc-post].  There was also a bug fix where a calculator could be initialized more than once depending on timing.  As always, feel free to leave feedback on the library.  Enjoy.
