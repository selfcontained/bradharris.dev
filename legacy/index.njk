  <p>
    Early on in my webdev professional journey I was full of what you might call spit and vinegar ðŸ˜… (I still have lots of energy, but I just wouldn't call it spit and vinegar anymore). I was soaking up everything I could about the web at my day jobs and as I'd hack on things on my own time. I wrote a bunch of short articles, most of which are pretty dated by today's standards, and of questionable value to anyone beyond myself. It's a bit of a view into the progression of what I learned between 2007 and 2015. Discovering the need for <a href="{{ '~/legacy/posts/2007-05-03_php-sessions-in-the-db.md' | url }}">managing sessions in a database</a>, early front-end development with <a href="{{ '~/legacy/posts/2008-07-23_back-to-firefox-2.md' | url }}">Firebug</a> and <a href="{{ '~/legacy/posts/2008-09-03_google-chrome-holy-smokes.md' | url }}">Google Chrome</a> being released. There's a handful of <a href="{{ '~/legacy/posts/2011-01-23_latest-endeavor-whoopdwhoop-com.md' | url }}">now-defunct sites and projects</a> I started, and diving into <a href="{{ '~/legacy/posts/2012-05-08_node-js-circular-dependencies.md' | url }}">node.js</a> as it was burgeoning. It's a bit of a stroll down memory lane, and a small window into what my early days of web development were like.
